    <p><strong>Weekly quizzes</strong> are short online quizzes completed at the beginning of your tutorial. See the
        Schedule above for the topics and dates of these quizzes. In general, they cover the material from the previous
        lectures and are closed book.</p>

    <p><strong>Lab exercises:</strong>In the tutorial, your tutor will review the completion of your completed lab
        exercises. You are encouraged to
        attempt to complete the set exercises before your tutorial so you have time to discuss any issues that arise
        with your tutor and have time to get them marked off.</p>

    <p><strong>Assignments: Parts 1, 2, and 3</strong> are incremental installments of a web site development task. In
        Part 1, you will demonstrate your ability to develop and deploy on a server well-structured, linked Web pages
        with text, graphics, tables, and forms, styled with CSS. Part 2 further extends the use of HTML elements and
        makes use of JavaScript to validate forms and add dynamic behavior to the Web page. In Part 3, you will use
        forms to submit and retrieve data from a server using PHP and MySQL.</p>
